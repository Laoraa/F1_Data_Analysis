# F1 Data Analysis Portfolio

This GitHub repository presents a collection of my data analysis and machine learning projects applied to Formula 1, developed using the FastF1 Python library. The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my data science skills—from manipulating raw data to building predictive models and creating advanced visualizations.

## Repository Structure

- `data/` : Contains the FastF1 data cache, organized by year, Grand Prix, and session.
- `Telemetry_analysis/` : Groups all notebooks for telemetry and performance analysis.
- `ML_prediction/` : Contains machine learning projects for predictive modeling.
- `docs/` : Contains documentation or project reports.

## Telemetry and Performance Analysis

This folder contains several detailed performance analyses, demonstrating my ability to interpret race data.

### `best_lap_race.ipynb` — *Race Lap Analysis*
A detailed examination of a driver's best race lap, identifying key moments and areas of advantage on a single lap.

### `best_lap_quali.ipynb` — *Qualifying Lap Analysis*
A comparative study of the fastest qualifying laps to identify specific areas on the track where one driver gains or loses time against a direct competitor.

### `tire_degradation.ipynb` — *Tire Degradation Analysis*
An analysis of a driver's performance throughout a Grand Prix. The project focuses on the degradation of each tire compound (Soft, Medium, Hard) and its impact on race pace.

**Skills Used**: `Python`, `FastF1`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Data Visualization`

## Predictive Modeling

This project demonstrates my machine learning skills for predictive applications in F1.

### `lap_time.ipynb` — *Lap Time Prediction*
Construction of a regression model to predict a driver's lap time based on key variables such as tire age, lap number, and track conditions.

**Skills Used**: `Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `Machine Learning`, `Regression`, `Feature Engineering`
